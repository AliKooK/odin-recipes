# odin-recipes
That's my first project with Odin project
this project basically will consist of a main page which will have links to a few recipes.
I am able to deal with the terminal of the ubuntu linux and I learned how to deal with github and git and how to link the repositories from github to git
after finishing the first part of the project (the html part), I will be able to make a basic html page and link it with other pages using the different types of links, and i will be able to use lists, headings and images with the different types it have.
also I will be able to demonstrate when to commit and what to write in the commit massage.
